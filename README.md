# Tinykart

This repository holds some basic test movement scripts for Tinykart, a project for creating autonomous little go-karts. The project was unfortunately never finished due to multiple factors outside the team's control, such as significantly late material shipments, component incompatibilites, and unexpected time constraints.

The movement scripts were used to debug the kart's basic motor skills, seeing it would process commands, how fast it would go, and how well it could handle turns.
